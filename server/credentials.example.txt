# Example credentials file for ZAPP Atlas server
# Each non-empty, non-comment line is "username:password"
# Whitespace around username or password is trimmed.
# This is a temporary scheme for development and manual testing only.

# Example users:
user1:pass1
user2:pass2

# Deployment notes:
# - Copy this file to server/credentials.txt and edit as needed
# - Or point the server to a custom path via the ZAPP_AUTH_FILE environment variable
#   e.g., ZAPP_AUTH_FILE=/path/to/credentials.txt
